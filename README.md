# SDS2-CHKPL-Plugin
This code was a plugin for a steel detailing software with the purpose of adding checkered plate to the 3D model in bulk. This plugin allowed detailers to add checkered plate entire plans at a time and it allowed the detailer to dictate the spacing of the plates.

This plugin uses an algorithm to find the best spacing for the checkered plate, allows for customized setbacks for each piece, and allows for custom area selection. It uses coordinates of existing memebrs to input the plate material at the correct locations.

This was one of my first real coding projects. Its not pretty, but it worked at the time. This code no longer works in new versions of SDS2.
